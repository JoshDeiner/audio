try out eleven lab experiment



update audio out to accept audio out cli argument and use better flags to mutate default behavuir

1. source flag a. text or filesystem

a) update file resolver to take in txt file.
	test to make sure works

files to update : controller, main, argumentparser.

update flag so that you can pass in cli flag and audio is not passed from machine.
	create --cli flag so that audio isnt transmitted only text is. this is obviously weird. because im planning to duplicate efforts and go from text - audo -text

	cli flag. this raises a job that ten passes audio again through a stt service and then writes to a output directory

attah functionality to audio out flag
