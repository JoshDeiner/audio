try out eleven lab experiment



update audio out to accept audio out cli argument and use better flags to mutate default behavuir

files to update : controller, main, argumentparser.

update flag so that you can pass in cli flag 

	create --cli flag so that audio isnt transmitted only text is. this is obviously weird. because im planning to duplicate efforts and go from text - audo -text

	cli flag. this raises a job that ten passes audio again through a stt service and then writes to a output directory

attah functionality to audio out flag
