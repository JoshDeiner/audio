build design pattern that is good for llms

to include and others

You're absolutely right. The Ethereum replica project, while organized, is a 
simpler frontend example. A more complex application using architectural 
patterns like services would indeed be much more beneficial for LLM 
comprehension. Here's why service-oriented and other advanced patterns are 
particularly helpful:

1. Service layer abstraction: When business logic is encapsulated in well-
defined services, an LLM can more easily understand the purpose and 
responsibility of each component without getting lost in implementation 
details.

2. Dependency injection: Clear dependency relationships help LLMs trace how 
components interact and identify potential issues in the flow of data or 
control.

3. Repository patterns: When data access is abstracted through repositories, 
LLMs can better understand data operations without needing to parse complex 
database queries inline.

4. Domain-driven design: When code reflects business domains with clear 
boundaries, LLMs can provide more contextually relevant suggestions aligned 
with business rules.

5. Interface-based programming: Well-defined interfaces make it easier for LLMs 
to understand contracts between components without needing to analyze all 
implementations.

6. Command/Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS): Separating read and write 
operations makes it clearer for LLMs to understand data flow and state changes.

7. Event-driven architecture: When systems communicate through well-defined 
events, LLMs can better trace complex interactions across components.

8. Microservices boundaries: Clear service boundaries with defined APIs help 
LLMs understand system components in isolation.

These patterns provide semantic structure that helps LLMs:
• Locate relevant code when answering specific questions
• Understand the "why" behind implementation choices
• Generate more appropriate suggestions that fit existing patterns
• Identify potential issues in architecture or implementation
• Provide more targeted refactoring suggestions

A complex backend application with services, repositories, controllers, and 
domain models would indeed be a much better example of code organization that 
benefits LLM comprehension compared to a simpler frontend project.
