"""Audio transcription and synthesis package.

This package provides functionality to:
1. Record audio from a microphone and transcribe it
2. Transcribe existing audio files using the faster-whisper model
3. Synthesize text into speech using gTTS
4. Play back synthesized audio

The package follows a service-oriented architecture with clear
separation of concerns between different components.
