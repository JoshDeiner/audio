Please help me implement best practices in my Python repository:

1. Apply PEP 8 style guidelines to ensure consistent code formatting
2. Set up Black as an auto-formatter with recommended configuration
3. Add isort for import sorting
4. Implement flake8 for linting and code quality checks
5. Create a pre-commit configuration to automate these checks
6. Add type hints where appropriate
7. Suggest any additional improvements for code organization and maintainability

Please provide specific commands and configuration files needed to implement these changes.
