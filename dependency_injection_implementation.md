# Dependency Injection Implementation

This document outlines the dependency injection implementation for the audio application, addressing the identified issues with hard-coded dependencies, singletons, and global state.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Created Service Interfaces

Created interfaces for all services in the `services/interfaces` package:
- `IBaseService`
- `IConfigurationManager`
- `IFileService` 
- `ITranscriptionService`
- `IAudioRecordingService`
- `IPlatformDetectionService`

### 2. Used Constructor Injection

- Modified service implementations to accept dependencies through their constructors
- Eliminated direct instantiation of dependencies within classes
- Implemented service implementations in a dedicated `services/implementations` package

### 3. Implemented a DI Container

Built a comprehensive DI container with advanced features:
- `DIContainer` with support for different service lifetimes:
  - Singleton (one instance for the entire application)
  - Scoped (one instance per scope/request)
  - Transient (new instance each time resolved)
- Automatic dependency resolution through constructor injection
- Factory support for complex instantiation scenarios
- Lazy resolution for improved performance

### 4. Replaced ServiceFactory with Proper DI

- Created a `ServiceProvider` to replace the old singleton `ServiceFactory`
- Implemented a facade over the DI container with a clean API for service resolution
- Provided a bootstrapper for configuring the DI container at application startup
- Added module auto-discovery for registering annotated services

### 5. Eliminated Global State and Singletons

- Removed singleton patterns from service implementations
- Eliminated static methods that accessed global state
- Replaced global access to `ConfigurationManager` with injected instances
- Refactored `PluginManager` to no longer rely on singleton pattern
- Created a `PluginProvider` to provide DI-friendly access to plugins

## Benefits

1. **Testability**: Services can now be easily tested in isolation by mocking dependencies
2. **Flexibility**: Implementations can be swapped without modifying client code
3. **Maintainability**: Dependencies are explicit and visible in constructor signatures
4. **Decoupling**: Services depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Service lifetimes are managed properly by the container

## Usage Example

```python
# Using the DI container directly
from dependency_injection.bootstrap import bootstrap_application
from dependency_injection.container_enhanced import DIContainer
from services.interfaces.transcription_service_interface import ITranscriptionService

# Bootstrap the application
container = DIContainer()
bootstrap_application()

# Resolve a service
transcription_service = container.resolve(ITranscriptionService)

# Using the service provider
from services.service_provider_enhanced import ServiceProvider

# Create a service provider
service_provider = ServiceProvider(container)

# Get services
file_service = service_provider.get_file_service()
audio_service = service_provider.get_audio_recording_service()

# Create a scoped service provider for request handling
request_scope = service_provider.create_scope()
scoped_service = request_scope.get(SomeServiceInterface)
```

## Key Files

1. `/dependency_injection/container_enhanced.py` - Core DI container implementation
2. `/dependency_injection/bootstrap.py` - Application bootstrapper for DI configuration
3. `/dependency_injection/module_loader.py` - Auto-discovery of injectable services
4. `/services/service_provider_enhanced.py` - Service provider facade
5. `/audio/application.py` - Application composition root

## Future Improvements

1. Complete the integration with the plugin system
2. Add property injection support for optional dependencies
3. Implement a full configuration system integrated with the DI container
4. Add more container lifetime options (e.g., per-thread scope)
5. Develop unit tests specifically for the DI system
