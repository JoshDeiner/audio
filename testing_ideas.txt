how should a file be tested semantically

ideas

ask the model to summarize what are the imports in the file doing

summarize what are the functions and any global resources doing

can they be expected to run without dependeneicnes?

if they need dependencies, check the rest of the application for dependencies

if they dont exist or there is some inconsistenty declare a flag or issue
