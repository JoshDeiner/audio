eas for Improvement

1. Code Structure Issues
   • There appears to be duplicated code in the file (multiple implementations of recording and transcription functions)
   • The file contains what looks like two versions of some functions that weren't properly merged
   • There's a redundant _display_recording_countdown function and another countdown implementation later in the code

2. Function Decomposition
   • Some functions are quite long and could be further decomposed following the best practices document
   • The record_audio function has multiple responsibilities that could be separated

3. Service-Oriented Architecture
   • The code doesn't fully follow the service-oriented architecture described in the ARCHITECTURE.md file
   • It would benefit from being organized into proper service classes as described in the style guide

4. Type Annotations
   • While type annotations are used, some complex types could use more specific typing from the typing module
   • Some return types are missing or could be more specific

5. Error Handling Patterns
   • The code doesn't implement the circuit breaker pattern mentioned in the style guide
   • Custom exception hierarchy is not fully implemented as recommended

## Specific Issues

1. Code Duplication: There are duplicate implementations of similar functionality, particularly in the recording and transcription logic.

2. File Structure: The file exceeds the recommended 500 lines mentioned in the style guide.

3. Inconsistent Error Handling: Some parts use detailed error handling while others use more generic approaches.

4. Missing Service Classes: According to the style guide, services should be implemented as classes with proper naming conventions.

5. Incomplete Implementation of Best Practices: Some of the patterns described in BEST_PRACTICES.md, like guard clauses and resource pooling, are not consistently applied.

## Recommendations

1. Refactor into Service Classes: Reorganize the code into proper service classes following the style guide.

2. Fix Code Duplication: Resolve the duplicate implementations and ensure consistent functionality.

3. Improve Function Decomposition: Break down larger functions into smaller, more focused ones.

4. Implement Custom Exception Hierarchy: Create a proper exception hierarchy as described in the style guide.

5. Apply Resource Management Patterns: Implement the resource management patterns described in the best practices document.

6. Organize into Modules: Split the code into multiple modules following the project structure recommendations.

The code shows good attention to documentation and type annotations, but needs structural improvements to fully align with the architecture and best practices defined in the qc
folder.
