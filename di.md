‚óè To fix dependency injection issues, I would:

  1. Create interfaces for all services and components
  2. Use constructor injection instead of direct instantiation
  3. Implement a DI container to manage dependencies
  4. Replace ServiceFactory with proper DI
  5. Eliminate global state and singletons
