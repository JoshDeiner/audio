## Key Changes Made

### 1. Interface Extraction
- Created interfaces for all services
- Moved from static methods to instance methods where appropriate
- Used abstract base classes to define contracts

### 2. Constructor Injection
- Refactored implementations to receive dependencies through constructor
- Eliminated direct instantiation inside services
- Updated signature of constructors to accept explicit dependencies

### 3. DI Container Implementation
- Created a basic and enhanced container implementation
- Added support for different service lifetimes (singleton, scoped, transient)
- Implemented auto-discovery of injectable services
- Added factory methods for complex service creation

### 4. Service Provider
- Created a service provider facade over the DI container
- Added methods for resolving services by interface
- Added support for scopes to manage service lifetimes

### 5. Bootstrapping
- Created bootstrapping code to configure the container
- Added registration of all core services
- Added plugin system integration

### 6. Eliminated Global State
- Removed singleton patterns from service implementations
- Removed static methods that accessed global state
- Enhanced services to use dependency injection instead of globals

## Before/After Example

### Before:
```python
class ApplicationService:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self.recording_service = AudioRecordingService()
        self.transcription_service = TranscriptionService()

    def run(self, duration: int = 5) -> Tuple[str, str]:
        # Method implementation...
```

### After:
```python
@Injectable(interface=IApplicationService)
class ApplicationService(IApplicationService):
    def __init__(
        self,
        recording_service: IAudioRecordingService,
        transcription_service: ITranscriptionService
    ) -> None:
        self.recording_service = recording_service
        self.transcription_service = transcription_service

    def run(self, duration: int = 5) -> Tuple[str, str]:
        # Method implementation...
```

## Path Forward

To complete the migration, the following steps are recommended:

1. Update controllers and application entry points to use the new DI container
2. Add unit tests that leverage the improved testability
3. Gradually phase out the old service implementations
4. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
5. Train team members on best practices for using DI

## Benefits Achieved

- **Improved Testability**: Services can now be easily tested in isolation with mocked dependencies
- **Reduced Coupling**: Services depend on abstractions not concrete implementations
- **Explicit Dependencies**: Dependencies are now visible through constructor parameters
- **Flexibility**: Can swap implementations without modifying client code
- **Lifecycle Management**: Service lifetimes are properly managed
- **Maintainability**: Code is more modular and easier to understand
