Review my implementation of the audio transcription feature that converts audio to text and writes to an output file. The feature should:

1. Take a WAV file from the input directory (AUDIO_INPUT_DIR)
2. Transcribe it using Whisper
3. Write the transcription to "transcript.txt" in the output directory (AUDIO_OUTPUT_DIR)

Please validate the following aspects of my implementation:

1. Are all necessary imports included for Whisper and file operations?
2. Does the code properly access the WAV file from the input directory?
3. Is the Whisper transcription implemented correctly?
4. Does the code properly write the transcription to the output directory?
5. Is there appropriate error handling for each step?
6. Are there any potential edge cases not being handled?

If you identify any issues or improvements, please:
1. Explain the issue clearly
2. Provide the corrected code snippet
3. Explain why your solution addresses the problem

Focus only on the core functionality of transcribing audio and writing to a file. Don't add new features beyond this scope.
