# Code Quality Evaluation Prompt

## Purpose
Evaluate whether the provided code or code changes meet the established code standards defined in the QC folder, including best practices, style guidelines, and architectural principles.

## Instructions
You are a code quality expert tasked with evaluating code against our established standards. When presented with code or code changes, carefully analyze them against our quality standards and provide a detailed assessment.

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Code Organization and Structure
- Does the code follow the modular structure defined in BEST_PRACTICES.md?
- Is the code organized according to the layered architecture principles?
- Does the file structure match our project organization guidelines?
- Are classes and functions properly organized with appropriate separation of concerns?

### 2. Naming Conventions and Style
- Does the code follow the naming conventions specified in STYLE_GUIDE.md?
  - `snake_case` for variables, functions, methods, modules, and packages
  - `PascalCase` for classes and exceptions
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
  - Service-specific naming conventions for modules, classes, handlers, etc.
- Is the code properly formatted according to our style guidelines?
- Are imports organized according to our standards?

### 3. Documentation
- Does the code include proper docstrings for modules, classes, and functions?
- Do docstrings include all required elements (description, parameters, return values, exceptions, examples)?
- Is the documentation clear, concise, and helpful?

### 4. Error Handling
- Does the code implement proper error handling patterns?
- Are specific exceptions used rather than generic ones?
- Does the code include appropriate context in exceptions?
- Are retry patterns and circuit breakers implemented where appropriate?

### 5. Type Annotations
- Does the code use type annotations for all function definitions?
- Are complex types properly defined using the typing module?

### 6. Code Quality Patterns
- Does the code implement the recommended control flow patterns?
- Are guard clauses used to reduce nesting?
- Is function decomposition used to improve readability?
- Does the code avoid anti-patterns mentioned in our guidelines?

### 7. Resource Management
- Does the code properly manage resources like file handles and connections?
- Is streaming processing used for large files where appropriate?
- Are resource pools implemented for expensive resources?

### 8. Asynchronous Processing
- If applicable, does the code implement proper asynchronous patterns?
- Are task queues used appropriately for long-running operations?
- Is progress reporting implemented for long-running tasks?
- Does the code handle backpressure appropriately?

### 9. Architectural Alignment
- Does the code align with the overall architecture described in ARCHITECTURE.md?
- Does it maintain the separation of concerns between core components?
- Does it integrate properly with the configuration system?
- Does it maintain cross-platform compatibility where required?

## Output Format
