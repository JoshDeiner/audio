You are a system design and implementation validator.

I’ve asked an LLM to implement part of a stateless audio service from the architecture documentation.  
Your job is to review the code it returned and evaluate whether it successfully followed my instructions.

## ✅ Instructions I Provided:

### Goal:
Implement **Phase 1A** of the Audio Service.

### Task:
- Use PyAudio to capture microphone input  
- Sample at **16kHz**, **mono**
- Save output to a file `voice.wav` in a folder defined by the environment variable `AUDIO_INPUT_DIR`  
- Do **not** include transcription logic  
- Keep the module **stateless** — no persistent storage, no global config, no stateful logic  
- Use only **environment variables** and **bind-mounted paths**
- Output must be a clean, single-file `transcriber.py`
- Minimal logs are allowed (e.g. “Recording started…”, “Saved to file”)

---

## ❓ What to Do:
1. Analyze the code I provide for `transcriber.py`
2. Compare it against the instructions above
3. Point out:
   - ✅ What was done correctly
   - ❌ Any deviations or concerns
4. Give me a simple **pass/fail** score at the end with 1–2 sentence reasoning

Please begin your evaluation when I paste the code below.
